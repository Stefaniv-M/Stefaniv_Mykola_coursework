# Twitter Mutual Friends Searcher by Stefaniv Mykola
This is a program I created as my coursework. It is operated
using command line interface in Python console window.

## Getting Started

To get this project running, copy "full.zip" archive from this repository. Then you
just have to unarchive the file and run "main.py" python file. In order for this to
run, Python 3.6 must be installed.

## Running the tests

There are no automated tests for this program because it is working with data that is constantly
changing. But command line interface is understandable
and self-explainatory. You just have to type "help" into the command line to get all the
information about the program.
